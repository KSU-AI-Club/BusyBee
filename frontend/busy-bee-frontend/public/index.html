      <p>
        BusyBee is a lightweight object detection model
        which can decipher what species a bee is and return
        information based on said species.        </p>

        <p>For the model team, we decided to go through seperate paths and test different state of the art models. 
          This includes Vision Transformers (ViT) and Large-Scale Convolutional Models (ResNet18, ResNet 50, VGG-16, etc.). 
          As of now, we are researching and experimenting different hyperparameter tuning, learning the insights of machine 
          learning libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, and  experimenting with object detection models such as YoloV8.
