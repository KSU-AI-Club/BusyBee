# BusyBee 🐝
The goal of project Busy Bee is to create a lightweight object detection model capable of identifying Bees and tracking their movements. If possible, we would like to also differentiate between different types of bees. We are resource constrained here, our final model will have to run on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ along with the Pi's 8-megapixel Camera Module 2. We would like to create a proof of concept for a trail-cam device that could one day be deployed in the wild.

# setup

create a venv

python -m venv ./busybee_venv

install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

# TODO
create a link to setup on the likes of huggingface or google colab
